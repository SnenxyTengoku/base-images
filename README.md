# Base images &nbsp; [![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/snenxytengoku/base-images/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/snenxytengoku/base-images/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Base images, made to be a minimal base for others to use. Should be self-maintained and always up-to-date.

Usually, images here are forked off other's worked but modified to fit better/more customizable needs.

Refer to [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org)'s documentation for more information.

## `niri`

Fedora image with niri included, and a few extras. Forked off of [Wayblue](https://github.com/wayblueorg/wayblue)'s `niri` image, but with less additions and clean-up/modernization of some modules.
